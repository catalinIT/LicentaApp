      "... and she approached me, and at that time that she had tripped over the rug and kind of bumped into me I was heading to the nursery, which is ammm ... I know you guys have all seen the layout, there's ahhh ... was a loveseat right there and a rocking chair right next to each other, and there's a little wall, and whenever she tripped over the rug she bumped into me and Grant approached her and grabbed her and kind of pulled her ... was pulling her back and just telling her to chill out, and she started fighting him, and whenever she did, that little wall right by the loveseat, she kicked it and whenever she did, they both went over the chair and landed on the floor, and I just went so ... I ran to the bedroom with Lily I didn't even stick around to see what happened, and when I got to the bedroom Little Grant was trying to come ... he was coming out of the door, and he asked me what that noise was and I told him that the chair fell and ... to come back into the bedroom, and ammm ... he asked where his daddy was and I told him he was picking up the chair.\n",
      "No sir I was not, not at all.\n",
      "He had told me that he had had a dream that, ammm ...he was in a forest and that he had killed Laura, and that if I didn't help him get rid of her, that he â€¦ that I was gonna be next.\n",
      "And he told me that, ammm â€¦ he was trying to figure some stuff out, and ammm â€¦ I asked him Like what? and he will â€¦ I mean I will never forget it, he was smoking a cigarette, and he was like really calm, and he looked at me and he said What would you say if I said â€¦ if I told you Laura was dead? And I was like, you know, I was like What? And â€¦ basically he told me that, ammm â€¦ the night that Laura had come over to the house, that she had died, and that whenever I left that he just panicked and freaked out, and I got â€¦ I started freaking out, and I was asking him why he didn't call the cops [stutters] â€¦ call for help like he told me he was going to, and he told me that, ammm â€¦ he got scared that he was a black man with a dead white woman and nobody was gonna believe him that it was an accident\n",
      "No, I didn't. The last time I saw her was whenever they fell, whenever I came out she was already in the bathroom. I never saw her ever. Whenever we got to the boat it was all covered up, honestly I didn't even know there was a middle seat until we saw the boat the other day.\n",
      "We had some drinks at the bar, maybe one ... two. Ammm â€¦ I got onto the dance floor myself as I explained, ammm â€¦ I have been a trained dancer for some time, going to be able to dance freely is like a ... release, I'm very much in my own space when I do that and so I got up, and I was dancing alone on the dance floor. He came to join the dance floor, ahhh â€¦ did not join me necessarily on the dance floor initially, and he was also ... dancing, and then ammm ... there was a time where he reached out his hand and ... as â€¦ the defense has said twirled me around and ammm ... that's it.\n",
      "Ahhh ... I didn't go to the dance club as a drinking activity, and nor did I know at the time that it was a dance club until we got in there.\n",
      "Ahhh ... When we got to the hotel, I remember, ammm â€¦  sitting, er â€¦ sitting briefly on the balcony of my room, but then that was that there was no other additional time if that's what you're asking. Besides what I â€¦ just explained, no.\n",
      "I have no idea. Uh, I was at work so I was presumably doing work things.  I'm s-sure it was -- nope. I'm sure it was work related. There's ... it does seem coincidental but I'm sure that there was something else going on that I had to call him about. I talk to him frequently about work matters. There's ....\n",
      "Uh, I had just been on a cruise with my husband. We hadn't been on a vacation for years, alone, without the children. (pause, clears throat) I had a project I needed to complete, and Hemy insisted it had to be completed that ... day, and so the only way in which to -- and it required his input, and the only way in which to finish it was to work on it that night\n",
      "I don't know, maybe ten ... nine thirty, ten, something along those lines. Might even have been slightly later.\n",
      "Ah, I don't remember but evidently I, I -- I tried to call Hemy, probably to tell him that I had left the office, and that I w -- that something had happened. Which seemed -- was a very normal thing for me to have done. Was to tell my boss that I had left the office and something had happened to my husband.\n",
      "I think when he was choking me, my hands were free because he was over my torso, my arms were free, so I may have, tried to push him off, or , I didnâ€™t want to injure him, I just wanted him to get off of me, but that was very quick and it didnâ€™t last long.\n",
      "Right after the shot occurred, um , we had fallen over in the bathroom again toward the  sink, the sink and garbage can area, kind of in the corner, and so he didn't chase me in that  moment, but that's where we struggled on the floor. And again as soon as I broke away, he  said \\F'ing kill you Bitch\\\" I don't remember a lot after that, so whether he chased me or not, I  couldn't say\"\n",
      "Well, what I do recall is when I filled the gas cans rather then have just a loose gas hose  somewhere I didn't have anywhere to put it, um so, I hung it up and when I  hung it up that ends the transaction, so that's probably why, I could have, you know mean, if I could of put them back in the trunk or whatever, then started the car or vise versa , um at one point, I didn't want to  ground, so I hung it up, and that ended the transaction, so thatâ€™s probably why there is more than one and maybe I was topping of the gas tank for another. \n",
      "Again, it took, it took a long time, it took a long time for me to get to this point, I never  wanted to admit to this and I'd written out all of my suicide letters, I sent my note, I sent them  all in an envelope to my grandmother, do not open until Nov 10th 2008, I was hoping to be  dead by then, giving myself a little time, to get my affairs in order, that date rolled by and then  more time rolled by and I was still here, so with the evolution of just time and the years that  went by, it was a gradual process, I began to feel not right about keeping it in instead.\n",
      "My attempt to talk to them was to present a better image of our relationship, and to downplay the negative aspects of it, like \\it's not really a big deal\\\" \\\"oh, it wasnâ€™t that bad\\\" that kinda thing, like \\\"oh, yeah, I knew that he did that, but that wasn't a big deal\\\" um, even our arguments, oh, sure it was rocky, there was turmoil, but we were friends, so my attempt was more to present a good image of Travis, and a good image of myself and that our relationship had it's ups and downs, but we were still um, on good terms.\"\n",
      "Well, again I can't, it happened so fast I did initially think Run, so I went down the hallway and then right as I got to the hallway, with the doors being shut, it just seemed like more of an obstacle it would give him more time to catch up, to open the door this way and run around it and out, when this door was an equal distance and open. I could run that way and into it. So my thought initially was to run out this door, and then around and out, but I was doing something just to create more distance, because last time I had run that same route and I was not successful in running out of the room.\n",
      "When I sort a came out of the fog, I realized \\oh, crap\\\" something bad had happened and I was scared to call any authority at that point.\"\n",
      "I do recall him screaming and yelling at me, um , so I don't know if that constitutes as talking, but he was saying words, the other things, I don't recall as far as being on all words, I don't.\n",
      "Well, I think that I have a good memory June 4th is an anomaly for me.  It's like I said yesterday, it's in a class of it's own. And I can't explain why, what kind of state of mind I was in, um it was, most of the day was an entire blank, and little pieces have come back, but not very many, So I can't explain that day alone but if you were, to put that day over here and over here all the other days of   memory issues that are any different from any average person.\n",
      "Lying is isn't something typically I just do. I'm not going to say I've never told a lie in my life before this ... incident, but, the lies I have told in this case are can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death, in any way. Because I was very ashamed of the death, and also I wanted to edify Travis in a good way, I didn't want to de- edify him or say hateful things about him, especially now that he had passed away and also I didn't want that to be construed as ... motive, for example if he was violent with me.\n",
      "So I was experiencing disorientation, I wasnâ€™t thinking gosh, Travisâ€™ just choked me out, I was ...  actually a thought just sort of wandered through my mind  Wheres Nepolian, in my head  so that was my thought and it didnâ€™t really have any relation to the event, that was just a thought. I was kinda getting my bearings, um, so there is, itâ€™s not completely clear, I just remember he had his hands around my neck, and he was banging my head on the carpet. I tried to push him off, and then it was, and then I blacked out. Really shortly after that.\n",
      "as far as details, every detail, I just sometimes I have a general sense of whatâ€™s going on, and sometimes I donâ€™t but as far as the fog goes, itâ€™s more of again, words that are being spoken, or screamed or yelled, and that what processing that sort of thing, physical things I can remember because I feel them physically, I can remember what I feel internally and emotionally as well, but itâ€™s more the words that are being spoken and their meanings, but I do remember how I feel, if that makes sense.\n",
      "I was, I believed that itâ€™s not okay in any circumstance to take someones life even if you are defending your own life thatâ€™s how I believed it So I never really stopped to consider how society would view it. If someone is defending themselves, I just felt like I had done something wrong and I was afraid of what the consequences would be.\n",
      "The lunging and the gun going off were sort of contemporanios, I donâ€™t remember how close they were or if it happened at exactly the same moment or one right after the other, it all happened very fast, and it all seemed to happen all at once, and I would say as far as distance, maybe as far as Mr. Babbikey (sp?) is, (court reporter?) but I couldnâ€™t say for sure with absolute certainty.\n",
      "Well, it happened very fast, I didnâ€™t have time to think everything just happened um, it seemed in a split second. So ... I really donâ€™t ... I just didnâ€™t have time to think to go this way or that way or to do this or that, it just happened without really thinking about the best move to make.\n",
      "it goes back to the choking incident and the fact that, when his body slammed me he was standing over me again I thought he was trying to get on top of me and even when we fell, I felt he was still trying to get on top of me by grabbing at me\n",
      "In a sense that is correct, I remember that. Dropping the knife, screaming and that  memory came much later,   Um, but it goes blank after that. I don't remember putting the gun in the car, I don't  remember putting the rope in the car, but I have, not crystal clear, but pretty, pretty solid  memories of disposing of those. So they did go in the car obviously, but I donâ€™t remember  placing them in the car.  \n",
      " Well ... I do know that we struggled that day, and based on logic it would have  because of how we fought . I don't know how things ended up, where they ended up. I just \n",
      "He said he was hungry, get something. I- there was a pizza receipt siting there. I called and ordered. When the pizza man came, it was right after Tim had been over. And when Tim was over, the guy had just stopped me. He was standing being that partially opened door Tim talked about, with a gun.\n",
      "I knew it. Get them kids back there, donâ€™t wanna look at you. I got a gun up here. Get them kids back there. Theyâ€™ll flail a little bit but get them back there. Where the police, come in and shot the boy where they were gone say they were? â€¦ Well I couldâ€™ve, look at all those rounds I had. If I wanted to kill someone, I could have. I werenâ€™t trying to kill nobody. They wasnâ€™t no hostages, young folk scared. You see the man, he made them testify. Them folk going to jail donâ€™t come here and say nothing on me. Oh I ainâ€™t just mad at them because I can understand you. They scared. And it shouldnâ€™t have to be like that. But people like that make them like that. You see he make [?] he [?]. You gone make me testify. Made him do it.\n",
      "He pushed me and I was up in his face. Definitely in his face. Pushed me, I don't know if he did it on purpose but he scratched my neck. And then he scratched my neck. I had a err...a rag t-shirt on anyway because I'd been taking care of my house. And he tore my shirt.\n",
      "I want to say, the prosecutor, I can't see her face but I wish I could. You disgust me. The Dorsey family disgusts me. Because how dare you say that happened to my son. You weren't there. Ya'll was never there. You were the absentee people ... always. So the Dorsey family, down to the mother, the father, to everybody- I hope ya'll live your lives well but Imma saying to my child, Gabrielle Blair, you lived well but Imma saying to 'em throughout their whole life. So live well now. You got not nothing else to say to me for I did for my child. Period.\n",
      "... brother, sister and his children...I know that he was a fun loving Uncle and I'm ... can't continue to experience things in his life ... for a kid ... there is certainly no way to explain ... make sense of the situation and I'm truly sorry for that.\n",
      "He straddled me and he hit me and then he started choking me. I couldn't breath my umm airway was cut off, I couldn't breath. Umm my head was hurting really bad. and it it felt like my head was gonna explode\n",
      "I was trying to say something but I couldn't talk. I tried to push him off me but he was too strong. Um all I could think about was my kids telling me \\Mom, you don't go, don't go.\"\n",
      "I didn't really know her too well, I only saw her a couple of times. Not really no, I wasn't placing her face with her address. No, I didn't talk to anybody, I just lived, I would go to school and come home.  Uh, no.\n",
      "Yes, he said he did. And he told me to take care of my wounds as necessary. No he said there was several wounds. Um he advised me to take Tylenol when I get the gel and um asked him for something to put on, put on my face.\n",
      "Remember, we withheld the evidence in this very important case that we want to try to get to the truth and to the bottom of. Well who says it not a criminal investigation, it's an investigation that is undetermined at this time. And uh we're just not prepared to make any assertions as to uh what the outcome is going to be until it's a full and thorough investigation.\n",
      "They found the man uh in the secure area with his luggage cart and chairs set around him. Uh they tried to do the same thing, communicate with him. Chairs went flying, he grabbed a computer off a desk and threw that. Um they just weren't getting through to this guy and the violence, again, escalating.\n",
      "It didn't have an instantaneous effect and Mr. Dziekanski still had the stapler in his hand. And uh he had not gone down. Just cause I was mistaken doesn't mean I was lying. I did the best job I could at the time.\n",
      "None of us. We're out there, looking for three people that were just involved in a uh shooting of another three individuals out on a street corner.\n",
      "We do not know about, how quote, responsible CHR's share holders are because that dataset is not available and is completely locked down. Any statements about responsible and quote law-abiding CHR are is completely anecdotal and therefore conjecture. \n",
      "The first time I remember Mr. Miller he was...having kinda like an argument with the officers as we were moving the people out of the area toward the street, so that they could uh block the uh sidewalk. And uh, he was being very aggressive with the officers, we didn't understand why. We just needed everybody to follow orders, we just wanted everybody's safety. I mean we just have to give the orders to step down to the street.\n",
      "No, not at any time. He called me some names, but that wasn't really a conversation.  It wasn't a two part conversation. \n",
      "He used the f word several times. Okay, I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that. He made mentioned of the f word towards me several times.  \n"
